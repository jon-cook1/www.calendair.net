Calendair is a simple tool for dynamic scheduling. For the sake of protecting sensitive user data I will not be posting the code at this time. Please visit the site to experience.

Designed to promote easy planning of tasks and events that arise in daily life. 

Built with a JavaScript (React) frontend and Python (Flask) backend. 
Deployed with AWS, including SSL/TLS encryption, rotating HTTPOnly JWTs for session management, protected RESTful API endpoints, rate limiting, and database (SQL) encryption to secure user data.
